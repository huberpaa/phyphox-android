# Eclipse paho

These libraries are directly included as the F-Droid build process has not white-listed the Eclipse paho libraries. Specifically, these libraries are used to offer MQTT functionality in phyphox and are included under the Eclipse Distribution Licence.

The Eclipse Paho project can be found at https://www.eclipse.org/paho and the Paho MQTT Android code is hosted at https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.android.
